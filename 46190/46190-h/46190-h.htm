<h2><a name="Stories_of_Robin_Hood" id="Stories_of_Robin_Hood">Stories of Robin Hood</a></h2>


<p>"And what of Peter the Ploughman? He was a
good friend of mine."</p>

<p>"Alack, Peter the Ploughman hath been hanged and
his wife and little ones turned out of their home to
beg."</p>

<p>The father of young Robin Hood with his little son
at his side, had met a man from his old home and was
eagerly questioning him about the welfare of his old
neighbors. But much of the news was sad, for the
times were evil in England. The Normans had conquered
the country and were the lords and officials in
the land, and they cruelly oppressed the common people,
who were Saxons. The father said not a word although
his face grew very sad, but the boy beside him burst
out indignantly.</p>

<p>"But why should such a thing be done? Peter the
Ploughman was one of the best men I ever knew and
his wife was as good and kind as an angel. Why
should such a dreadful thing be done to them?"</p>

<p>"Because he shot deer in the king's forest. But
indeed he had an excuse for breaking the law if ever
a man did. His crops had been destroyed by the
huntsmen riding through them. The tax collector had
taken all that he had, and his children were crying for
hunger. He shot the deer that they might have food
to eat; but the sheriff caught him and hung him for
it. As to the reason why his wife was turned out from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
her home with her orphan children, the abbot wanted
that bit of ground for an extension to his garden, so
out the poor folks must go."</p>

<p>"It's a shame," cried the boy with flashing eyes.
"Such laws as that are wicked laws and ought to be
broken. The greedy lords and rich, ease-loving churchmen
strip the people bare and go rolling in wealth
while the rest of the people are starving."</p>

<p>"Hush, boy, hush," said the news-teller warningly.
"Our England is indeed cruelly misgoverned, but it is
not safe to say so, for the very walls have ears and
many have been hanged because their tongues wagged
too freely, as well as for shooting the king's deer."</p>

<p>"But the king,&mdash;the king is good," faltered the
boy. He had been taught to love and reverence the
king.</p>

<p>"The king would be a good king if he would stay at
home and govern his people. But he is off at war all
the time, and the nobles and officers he appoints grind
the people as a miller grinds the wheat between his
great millstones. They rob them continually, and the
rich are growing richer and more greedy and the poor
growing poorer and more miserable all the time."</p>

<p>"When I am a man," said the boy, Robin Hood, "I
will make the rich give up a portion of their wealth to
the poor, and then all will be provided for."</p>

<p>It was not strange, perhaps, considering the evils of
the times, that this boy, Robin Hood, when he became
a man, did do just what he said, and gathered a band
of men about him in the forest whose pledged purpose
was to despoil the rich of ill-gotten wealth and
lend a helping hand to the poor. The Normans called
them "highway robbers," but the common people called
them "the merry men of greenwood" and loved them,
for they were often helped out of trouble by them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
Their robbing was certainly wrong according to our
standards, but Robin Hood did not think it was wrong.
He took from the rich what they had wrung unjustly
from the poor to give it back to the poor, and he
thought that it was right. Outlaw though he was, he
stood ever for justice and fairness as he saw it. He
was loyal to the king, though he resisted the unjust
exactions made in the king's name. He was loyal to
the church and prayed most reverently for himself and
his band. It was his pride that he and his men had
never harmed a woman, or burned a haystack, or
robbed a husbandman, or hurt a parish priest. The
Normans did all these things. Compared with their
actions, Robin Hood's standards were wonderfully high.</p>

<p>He was trying to be a reformer; and though he
went about his work in a wrong way, still he did much
good. As the quaint old ballad says about him&mdash;in
queer spelling which I revise,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Christ have mercy on his soul<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That died on the rood!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For he was a good outlaw<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And did poor men much good."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He was brave and kind and merry always, and all
the English people&mdash;except England's oppressors&mdash;loved
him with all their hearts and delighted in his
adventures. The story of what he did was put into
songs and sung at every fireside; and no man was better
loved than this outlaw with a price upon his head.</p>

<p>Here are a few stories of Robin Hood and his men,
and a great many more may be found which are well
worth your reading.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="WINNING_THE_SHERIFFS_GOLDEN_ARROW" id="WINNING_THE_SHERIFFS_GOLDEN_ARROW">WINNING THE SHERIFF'S GOLDEN ARROW</a></h2>


<p>It was very pleasant in Sherwood Forest to those
who did not fear hardship, and Robin Hood and his
men came to love every tree that grew and every bird
that sang there. They did not mind that they had no
houses to live in. They made themselves shelters of
bark and logs to keep the rain off, and mostly they
stayed in the open. They did not sigh for soft beds or
fine tables and furnishings. They put down rushes
and spread deer skins over them to lie on, and slept
under the stars. They cooked over a great fire built
beside a big tree, and they sat and ate on the ground.</p>

<p>More than a hundred men were in Robin Hood's
band; every one was devoted to him and obeyed his
slightest word. They were the best archers, the best
wrestlers, the best runners and the best wielders of
cudgel and quarter-staff in all the country, and they
grew better continually, for they practiced these things
every day.</p>

<p>Robin Hood was the best archer in all the land.
Even the king had heard of his wonderful marksmanship,
and even though he knew him an outlaw, he had
an admiring and almost kindly feeling for this bold
outlaw who shot so marvelously well. But the greedy
lords and churchmen who oppressed the people hated
Robin Hood; and the sheriff of Nottingham hated him
most of all, and wished above all things to hang him
on the gallows.</p>

<p>He was a cruel, hard man with no kindness in his
bosom, and all his spite was turned against Robin
Hood, because every time that he tried to catch him,
Robin outwitted him. Now he was especially angered,
for he had sent a messenger with a warrant to take
Robin Hood and the merry Robin had met the messenger
and feasted him, and then, while he was asleep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
after the feast, stolen the very warrant out of his
pocket so that he had to go back to the sheriff without
man or warrant either. So the sheriff of Nottingham
used all his wits to get another plan to take Robin
Hood. It was plainly of no use to send men, no matter
how stout, with warrants after him. He must be
coaxed into their clutches.</p>

<p>"I have it," said the sheriff of Nottingham at last,
with a very sour look on his grim face. "I'll catch
him by craft. I'll proclaim a great archery festival,
and get all the best archers in England to come here
to shoot. I'll offer for the prize an arrow of beaten
gold. That will be sure to fetch Robin Hood and his
men here, and then I'll catch them and hang them."</p>

<p>Now Robin Hood and his men did come to the archery
contest. But they did not come in the suits of Lincoln
green that they wore as men of the forest. Each man
dressed himself up to seem somebody else. Some appeared
as barefoot friars, some as traveling tinkers or
tradesmen, some as beggars, and some as rustic peasants.
Robin Hood was the hardest to recognize of all.</p>

<p>"Don't go, master," his men had begged. "This
archery contest is just a trap to catch you. The sheriff
of Nottingham and his men will be looking for you and
they will know you by your hair and eyes and face and
height, even if you wear different clothes. The sheriff
has made this festival just to lure you to death. Don't
go."</p>

<p>But Robin Hood laughed merrily.</p>

<p>"Why, as to my yellow hair, I can stain that with
walnut stain. As to my eyes, I can cover one of them
with a patch and then my face will not be recognized.
I would scorn to be afraid, and if an adventure is
somewhat dangerous, I like it all the better."</p>

<p>So Robin Hood went, clad from top to toe in tattered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
scarlet, the raggedest beggarman that had ever been
seen in Nottingham. The field where the contest was
to be held was a splendid sight. Rows and rows of
benches had been built on it for the gentlefolk to sit
on, and they wore their best clothes and were gayer
than birds of paradise. As for the sheriff and his
wife, they wore velvet, the sheriff purple and his lady
blue. Their rich garments were trimmed with ermine.
They wore broad gold chains around their necks, and
the sheriff had shoes with wondrously pointed toes that
were fastened to his gold-embroidered garters by golden
chains. Oh! they were dressed very splendidly, and
if their faces had been kind, they would have looked
beautiful. But their faces were full of pride and hate.
The sheriff was looking everywhere with spiteful
glances for Robin Hood, and very cross he was that
he did not see Robin there.</p>

<p>But Robin was there, though the sheriff did not see
him. There he stood in his ragged beggar's garments,
not ten feet away from the sheriff.</p>

<p>The targets were placed eighty yards from where
the archers were to stand. Pace that off, and see
what a great distance it is. There were a great number
of archers to shoot and each was to have one shot.
Then the ten who shot best were to shoot two arrows
each; and the three who shot best out of the ten were
to shoot three arrows apiece. The one who came nearest
to the center of the target was to get a prize.</p>

<p>The sheriff looked gloweringly at the ten.</p>

<p>"I was sure that Robin Hood would be among
them," he said to the man-at-arms at his side. "Could
no one of these ten be Robin Hood in disguise?"</p>

<p>"No," answered the man-at-arms. "Six of these I
know well. They are the best archers in England.
There is Gill o' the Red Cap, Diccon Cruikshank,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
Adam o' the Dell, William o' Leslie, Hubert o' Cloud,
and Swithin o'Hertford. Of the four beside, one is
too tall and one too short and one not broad-shouldered
enough to be Robin Hood. There remains only this
ragged beggar, and his hair and beard are much too
dark to be Robin Hood's, and beside, he is blind in one
eye. Robin Hood is safe in Sherwood Forest."</p>

<p>Even as he spoke, the man-at-arms was glad, for he
was but a common soldier, and he loved Robin Hood
and wished no harm to come to him. One reason why
Robin Hood got away from the sheriff so many times
was that the common people, even among the sheriff's
own men, were friendly to him and helped him all
they could. The gatekeepers shut their eyes when
Robin Hood went through the gates that they might
say they had not seen him enter. Hardly any one
would betray him, and many, when they knew of evil
being planned against him, sent warning to him. But
even the man-at-arms who loved him did not recognize
Robin Hood today.</p>

<p>The ten made wonderful shots. Not one arrow
failed to come within the circles that surrounded the
center. But when the three shot, it was more wonderful
still. Gill o' the Red Cap's first arrow struck only
a finger's breadth from the center, and his second was
nearer still. But the beggar's arrow struck in the
very center. Adam o' the Dell, who had one more
shot, unstrung his bow when he saw it.</p>

<p>"Fourscore years and more have I shot shaft, and
beaten many competitors, but I can never better that,"
he said.</p>

<p>The prize of the golden arrow belonged to the
tattered beggar, but the sheriff's face was very sour
as he gave it to him. He tried to induce him to enter
his service, promising great wages.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p>"You are the best archer I have ever seen," he
said. "I trow you shoot even better than that rascal
and coward of a Robin Hood who dared not show his
face here today. Will you join my service?"</p>

<p>"No, I will not," answered the scarlet-clad stranger,
and then the sheriff looked at him so spitefully that he
knew it was well to get away. As he walked toward
Sherwood Forest, the sheriff's words rankled.</p>

<p>"I cannot bear to have even my enemy think that I
am a coward," he said to Little John. "I wish there
was a way to tell the sheriff that it was Robin Hood
that won his golden arrow."</p>

<p>And they found a way. That evening the sheriff
sat at supper, and though the supper was a fine one,
his face was gloomy.</p>

<p>"I thought I could catch that rascal Robin Hood by
means of this archery contest," he said to his wife,
"but he was too much of a coward to show his face
here."</p>

<p>Just then something came through the window and
fell rattling among the dishes on the table. It was a
blunted gray goose quill with a bit of writing tied to
it. The sheriff unfolded the writing. It told that it
was Robin Hood who had won the golden arrow.
When the sheriff read it, even his wife thought best to
slip away, for he was the crossest man in Nottingham.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="HOW_LITTLE_JOHN_JOINED_ROBIN_HOOD" id="HOW_LITTLE_JOHN_JOINED_ROBIN_HOOD">HOW LITTLE JOHN JOINED ROBIN HOOD</a></h2>


<p>This is the story of how Robin gained his right hand
man and dearest friend, Little John. Little John was
one of the tallest and strongest youths that ever walked
through a forest. When Robin Hood first saw him, he
was walking in the edge of the forest and came to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
narrow bridge across a stream. The bridge was so
narrow that but one could go across it at once, and it
chanced that Robin Hood stepped upon it from one side
just as Little John stepped on the other end.</p>

<p>"Go back, and let the better man cross before you,"
called Robin Hood, not because he cared a bit but rather
with a mirthful wish to see what the tall youth would do.</p>

<p>"Stand back yourself. I am the better man,"
cried the stranger.</p>

<p>"Let us fight for it," said Robin Hood, who loved
a good bout more than his dinner.</p>

<p>"With all my heart," answered the stranger.</p>

<p>Then Robin cut him a stick of oak to serve as a
quarter-staff, for he would have held it a shame to use
his bow and arrows when the other had no such
weapon, and they met as joyously as two boys wrestling
for sport.</p>

<p>"The one who can knock the other into the water is
the better man," said Robin. Then the fight with the
staves began. What a fight it was! They struck
again and again, but so skilful was each one in warding
off blows that neither could knock the other down.
Many hard blows each one took, until there were sore
bones and bumps, and black and blue spots in plenty,
but neither thought of stopping for that. A whole
hour they fought there on the bridge, and neither
could get the better of the other, then another hour.
At last Robin gave the stranger a terrible whack that
made him stagger, but the stranger returned with a
crack on the crown that made the blood flow. Robin
whacked back at him savagely, but the stranger avoided
the blow and gave one to Robin that tumbled him
fairly into the water.</p>

<p>He lay there looking up and laughing, for Robin
Hood never bore any malice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>"You have a right sturdy hand with the cudgel.
Never have I been beaten before," he laughed. He
splashed ashore and seized the stranger's hand.</p>

<p>"I like you well," he said. "Now watch, and I
will show you something."</p>

<p>He put his horn to his lips and blew, and up came
two score of Robin Hood's followers, all clothed in
Lincoln green, and bearing bows and arrows and
swords.</p>

<p>"How is this, master?" said the foremost. "You
are all bruised and wet to the skin."</p>

<p>"Yon sturdy fellow has given me a drubbing and
tumbled me into the water," he said.</p>

<p>"Then he shall get a ducking and a drubbing himself,"
said Will Stutely, starting forth angrily, followed
by half a dozen, all eager to carry out his threat.
But Robin Hood ordered him back.</p>

<p>"No," he said, "it was a fair fight, and he won. I
would not have you hurt him for anything. But he is
a right brave and lusty youth and I would fain have
him in our band. Will you join yourself to my men?"
he asked of the wondering stranger. "I am Robin
Hood, and my band is the finest in all England."</p>

<p>Hardly a man in the country but would have trembled
at the name. But John Little, the strange youth, was
afraid of no man.</p>

<p>"If there is any man among you who can shoot a
better shaft than I, I will," he said.</p>

<p>"Well, I will try," said Robin. He sent Will
Stutely to set up a piece of white bark four fingers in
breadth on an oak eighty yards away.</p>

<p>"Now choose any of our bows and arrows to shoot
with," he said.</p>

<p>The stranger chose the very stoutest bow. Then he
aimed his arrow carefully and sent it down the path<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
and it struck the very center of the mark. All Robin
Hood's followers caught their breaths in amaze.</p>

<p>"That is a fine shot indeed," said Robin Hood heartily.
"No one could better it; but perhaps I may mar it."</p>

<p>Then he shot an arrow; and so true and swift it
sped that it struck the stranger's arrow and splintered
it into pieces. And all who saw it cried out that there
never was such shooting before.</p>

<p>"Now, will you not come into my band?" said Robin
Hood with a smile.</p>

<p>"With all my heart," answered the stranger; and
from that minute he loved Robin as his dearest friend.</p>

<p>"What is your name?" said Will Stutely, taking
out a tablet as though he would enroll it.</p>

<p>"John Little," answered the stranger youth.</p>

<p>"I like not the name," said merry Will. "This
fellow is too small to be called John Little. Let us
christen him over, Little John."</p>

<p>And so they had a christening and great sport; and
from that day Little John was Robin's right hand man
and second in command over the band. True and
faithfully did he serve Robin for many years and loved

<h2><a name="ALLEN-A-DALE_AND_FRIAR_TUCK" id="ALLEN-A-DALE_AND_FRIAR_TUCK">ALLEN-A-DALE AND FRIAR TUCK</a></h2>


<p>This is the story of a merry friar and how he came
to belong to Robin Hood's band. But it begins with
the story of a sad youth with a harp in his hand, who
could sing as sweetly as a thrush but who thought that
he would never sing again for his heart was breaking.
Robin Hood and his men found him in the forest, lying
prone on the ground and sobbing as if he would weep
his eyes out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>"Get up! Get up!" shouted Will Stutely, poking
him with his foot. "I do hate to see a tall young fellow
snivelling like a girl of fourteen over a dead bird."</p>

<p>But Robin Hood bade the others stand back, and
touched the boy kindly.</p>

<p>"You are in trouble," he said. "Do not mind what
these fellows say. They are rough, but their hearts
are kind. Come with me and tell me what is wrong."</p>

<p>"Everything is wrong," said Allen-a-Dale miserably,
and it was true that things were going very badly with
him. For his true love and promised bride had been
forced to give him up and promise her hand to a rich
old knight who won her father's favor by means of his
money.</p>

<p>"She will marry the old knight if her father bids
her," cried Allen-a-Dale, "for she thinks it right to
be an obedient daughter; but I know it will break her
heart and she will die."</p>

<p>"Now this thing shall not be," cried Little John,
starting forward. "Master, can we not prevent such
a wrong?"</p>

<p>"We will see," answered Robin Hood.</p>

<p>"But she is to be married in two days."</p>

<p>"Then we will go to the church and see that she is
married to you instead of the old knight. But we will
need to find a priest who will marry you."</p>

<p>"Then I know the very priest," said Will Scarlet.
"It is jolly Friar Tuck who lives in Fountain Dale."</p>

<p>"Then let us go and get him at once. We have no
time to lose," said Robin Hood; and out they started
without delay. Little John, Will Scarlet, young David
of Doncaster, and Arthur-a-Bland went with him.
They wore their best clothes.</p>

<p>"For," said Robin Hood, "we must look brave when
we go to a wedding."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>After they had walked a whole morning, they came
to the bend in the river beyond which Friar Tuck
dwelt. But his cell was across the river and to get to
it they would have to wade through.</p>

<p>"Well," said Robin Hood, "had I known I would
have to wade the river I would not have put on my
best clothes."</p>

<p>Then he left his men, bidding them listen if his
bugle should sound, and went on alone. As soon as
he was out of sight of them, he thought he heard
voices. There seemed to be two men talking on the
river bank below, but the voices were wondrously
alike. Robin Hood slipped to the edge and looked
over.</p>

<p>With his broad back against a willow tree, sat a
stout, brawny fellow in the robe of a friar, but no
other man was by. He held a great pie in his lap,
made of tender, juicy meats, compounded with young
onions and other toothsome vegetables, which he
munched at sturdily. As he ate he talked, and, listening
to him, Robin Hood almost died of laughing. For
the merry friar was pretending to be two people. He
would offer a piece of the pasty first to his right hand
and then to his left, with much politeness, and go
through the same actions with a bottle of drink that
he had. Robin looked and listened till the pie was all
gone and the bottle empty. Then the monk began to
urge his imaginary companion to sing.</p>

<p>"Now, sweet lad," he said to himself, "canst thou
not tune me a song?" And then he answered himself
bashfully.</p>

<p>"La, I know not. I am but in ill voice this day.
Prythee, ask me not: dost thou not hear how I croak
like a frog?"</p>

<p>Then he spoke again as the first one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nay, nay, thy voice is as sweet as any bullfinch.
Come sing, prythee. I would rather hear thee sing
than eat a fair feast."</p>

<p>And so it went on till he began singing and that
was as two persons, too. The song he sang was a duet
between a youth and a maid, and he sung the maiden's
part very high and squeaky and the youth's very deep
and gruff. It was the funniest thing you can imagine,
and when the last chorus was reached Robin Hood could
hold in no more but joined in with the singing lustily.</p>

<p>Then the friar leaped forth, crying, "What spy have
we here?" and from beneath his monk's robe he drew
forth a sword as heavy and stout as any that Robin
Hood's band carried.</p>

<p>"Put up thy sword, friend," called Robin. "Folks
that have sung together should not fight." And then
he leaped down beside the friar.</p>

<p>"Do you know the country round about, good and
holy man?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, somewhat," answered the friar cautiously.</p>

<p>"And do you know a spot called Fountain Dale, and
a certain monk who is called the Curtal Friar of Fountain
Abbey?"</p>

<p>"Yes, somewhat."</p>

<p>"Is it across the river?" asked Robin Hood.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered the monk.</p>

<p>"Do you know whether this friar is now on the
other side of the river or on this side?" asked Robin.</p>

<p>"That," answered the friar very deliberately, "is
something you will have to find out for yourself."</p>

<p>This angered Robin, and indeed it was not at all
civil.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "if I must cross the river, I must
ask you to carry me across, for you can see that my
clothes are such as the water would injure."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>At first the friar was angry at the request, but soon
a different thought seemed to come to him and he
laughed.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "if the holy St. Christopher
carried pilgrims across the river, perhaps I ought to do
so also. Give me your sword that it may not get wet,
and I will carry you."</p>

<p>So he tucked his own sword and Robin's under his
arm, bent his back for Robin to get on it, and waded
across the water. He put Robin down very gently on
the other bank, but he did not give him back his sword.</p>

<p>"Thanks, good father," said Robin. "Give me my
sword, and I will away."</p>

<p>"Nay, good youth," answered the friar, pointing
the sword at Robin. "You see, I got wet crossing the
river. It is necessary for me to cross again, but I fear
if I got wet once more I might get a crick in my back
that would hinder my prayers. I pray thee, carry me
back."</p>

<p>He had the sword, and there was nothing for Robin
to do but to obey. So he carried the friar back, and it
was harder than for the friar to carry him. But while
they were in the stream he managed to loosen Friar
Tuck's sword belt so that when they got to land he
snatched it off. Now Robin Hood had the two swords.</p>

<p>"Now carry me across again," he said.</p>

<p>It is a long story; but the end of it is that Friar
Tuck carried Robin Hood half way across the river,
and there dumped him into the water "to cool off,"
as he said. Then Robin fought with him; but, though
they fought together with might and main for hours,
neither could overcome the other. And so they ceased
to fight and became friends; and Friar Tuck willingly
consented to go with him and perform the marriage
between Allen-a-Dale and his fair Ellen, no matter
what a pother it raised.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>So now Robin Hood and a score of his merry men
set out to the wedding which was to be held in Emmet
Church. Robin Hood was dressed as a strolling minstrel,
and across his shoulders he had slung a harp.
Leaving the most of his followers in hiding a little
distance from the church, he went in boldly.</p>

<p>It was to be a very grand wedding, and the Bishop
of Hereford himself was to perform the ceremony. He
came with a long train of followers, and as he entered
he saw Robin with his harp beside the door.</p>

<p>"Now, who are you?" he asked, well pleased, for
everybody loved to see a minstrel.</p>

<p>"I am a harper from the north country," answered
Robin Hood. "I can play such music as never another
in all England can do. For there is magic in my harping,
and if I play at this wedding, it will insure that
the fair bride shall love the man she marries with her
whole heart all her life long."</p>

<p>"Marry then, let him play," said Sir Stephen, the
old bridegroom. He knew that it was her father's will
instead of her own wish that made the fair Ellen marry
him. But he did not know that she loved another, for
her father had concealed it from him.</p>

<p>And now the bride's father brought in the bride,
and she was the most beautiful maiden they had ever
seen. But she was pale and wan and she drooped on
her father's arm like a broken lily.</p>

<p>"How is this?" cried Robin Hood. "A bride should
be like a blushing rose. Maiden, is it of your own
free will that you wed with this knight?"</p>

<p>"No, no," sobbed fair Ellen. "I wish to wed no
one but my own true love, Allen-a-Dale the minstrel."</p>

<p>"Then Allen-a-Dale ye shall wed," cried Robin
Hood, and set his bugle to his lips and blew. The followers
who had entered the church and Friar Tuck<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
came running down the aisles and gathered around
him. Then came a scene of confusion. The bishop of
Hereford, the prior of Emmet and all his train commanded
the people to seize Robin Hood, but they would
not do it. The old knight who was the bridegroom
sought to draw his sword, but he wore no sword on his
wedding day.</p>

<p>"At them and slay them," he cried to his men-at-arms.
But just at that minute there came running up
at double quick the rest of Robin Hood's men, with
swords drawn and bows and arrows hanging at their
backs.</p>

<p>"I will depart," said the bridegroom to the bride's
father. "I would not marry your daughter now for all
the kingdom of England."</p>

<p>He spoke angrily, for he felt that he had been
cheated, not knowing that the maiden loved some one
else. The prior of Emmet, calling his train, also departed
in high displeasure, and the bishop of Hereford
would have gone too, but Robin bade him stay.</p>

<p>"Now," he said, "we will have a wedding, and fair
Ellen shall marry Allen-a-Dale."</p>

<p>"Ye cannot." The prior of Emmet turned back to
say this. "You have no priest to marry them."</p>

<p>"Am I not a priest?" bellowed Friar Tuck, so
fiercely that the prior shook in his pointed shoes and
made haste to get away.</p>

<p>"But the banns have not been published," said the
bride's father.</p>

<p>"I will publish them," roared Friar Tuck; and the
old song says that he cried them three times, the number
required by law, and then, lest that should not be
enough, he cried them six times more.</p>

<p>"But I cannot be married without my father's blessing,"
sobbed Ellen, for she was ever an obedient
daughter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>"There, there, don't cry," said Robin Hood gently.
"I will get your father's blessing." Then he called
to Will Stutely.</p>

<p>"Give me the two bags of gold I bade you bring."
He strode up to Ellen's father with a bag of gold in
each hand.</p>

<p>"Here are two hundred golden angels," he said.
"If you give your daughter your blessing on this her
wedding day, I will give you these as her dower. If
you give her not the blessing, she shall be married
just the same, but not a cracked farthing shalt thou
have."</p>

<p>The father looked at the gold and then at Robin
Hood. He knew the knight was gone and would not
come back.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, but not happily, "I will give her
my blessing."</p>

<p>So the wedding went on; and after it was over they
went to Sherwood Forest and held the merriest feast
that ever was held in that merry place. And Allen-a-Dale
and his bride lived happy all the rest of their
lives, and he sang such beautiful songs that his fame
went all over England. As for Friar Tuck, he liked
Robin Hood and his band so much that he never went
back to Fountain Dale but became one of Robin Hood's
merry men.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="ROBIN_HOOD_AND_THE_SORROWFUL_KNIGHT" id="ROBIN_HOOD_AND_THE_SORROWFUL_KNIGHT">ROBIN HOOD AND THE SORROWFUL KNIGHT</a></h2>


<p>"We have had no guests for a long time," said
Robin Hood one day. "Let us go out and look for
some. Little John, you go to the east and I will go to
the west, and we will see if we do not find passing a
greedy noble, or fat churchman who carries too much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
of this world's goods with him, and needs to be relieved
for the good of the poor."</p>

<p>Now when Robin Hood and his men robbed a man&mdash;and
they never molested any but the rich who had
made their wealth by grinding down the poor&mdash;they
brought him into the forest and made a feast for him.
Then, after he had feasted, they told him he must
pay his reckoning, and they took his goods or gold that
he carried and divided these into three piles. One-third
they gave back to him; one-third they kept for
themselves; and the other third they distributed to the
poor. The rich and grasping shuddered at the very
mention of Robin Hood's feasts, but the poor breathed
blessings on his name whenever they thought of them.</p>

<p>So Little John and his part of the band went to the
east; and they were lucky, for they brought in the
rich bishop of Hereford with five sumpter mules loaded
with goods. But Robin Hood and his half found only
a sorrowful knight who sighed as he rode along and
seemed too sad to notice anything. Robin Hood laid
his hand on his bridle, stopping his horse.</p>

<p>"Hold," he said. "I would speak with you."</p>

<p>"Now who are you who would stop a peaceful traveler
on the king's highway?" asked the knight.</p>

<p>"Some call me an honest man and some call me a
robber," answered Robin Hood. "At any rate, I and
my men have an inn in the forest where we want you
to stop and feast. But we let you know that we count
upon our guests paying their reckoning."</p>

<p>"I take your meaning," answered the knight, "but
I am no guest for you, for I have no money. Indeed,
I am in great sorrow by reason of this very thing.
Having great need of money to save the life of my
son, I mortgaged my estate to the prior of Emmet and,
though I could raise the money if he would give me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
more time, he will not give me a day, but means to
seize the estate and turn me out a beggar."</p>

<p>"How much money did you borrow of him?" asked
Robin Hood.</p>

<p>"Only four hundred pounds. The estate is worth
many times that but he will show no mercy."</p>

<p>"Have you no friends who could lend you the
money?" asked Robin Hood.</p>

<p>"Alas, no," answered the knight. "When I was
fortunate I had many friends who crowded around me,
but now that I have come to trouble they have all deserted
me."</p>

<p>"Well, the men who are in trouble always have
friends in Sherwood Forest," answered Robin Hood.
"Come with me as a free guest and we will find a way
to help you."</p>

<p>So they went on until they came to the great tree
where Friar Tuck and half a dozen others were preparing
the feast around a huge fire. And there in the
light of the flames sat the bishop of Hereford under
guard, with his sumpter mules with their loaded packs
tied to the trees around.</p>

<p>"Have mercy," he whined. But Robin Hood
answered sternly.</p>

<p>"What mercy have you ever shown to the poor?
Men, open his packs!"</p>

<p>So they opened the packs, which were full of rich
goods and divided them into three parts. Beside the
packs of goods there was a box that held fifteen hundred
pounds in gold. Robin Hood took up the portion
divided out for the poor and gave it to the sorrowful
knight.</p>

<p>"Since the churchmen have despoiled you, the
churchmen shall help you," he said.</p>

<p>"Oh, I thank you," cried the knight, his sorrowful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
face lighting up for the first time that day. "But I
will not take it as a gift but as a loan. I will pay it
back to the bishop or to you."</p>

<p>The bishop nodded and opened his mouth to say
"That is well," but Robin Hood interrupted him
shortly.</p>

<p>"Pay it to me," he said. "I will help the poor
with it. The bishop would but crowd it into his own
coffers, and use it to gain more money."</p>

<p>So the knight who had been so sorrowful departed
with all his troubles cleared away. Sorely disappointed
was the prior of Emmet for he had made sure by cheating
and craft that the poor knight who had fallen into
his clutches could not get the money to redeem his
lands anywhere, and he counted them already in his
grasp. But he had to give them up; and that is a
story too, but we have not room to tell it here.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="ROBIN_HOOD_AND_THE_KING" id="ROBIN_HOOD_AND_THE_KING">ROBIN HOOD AND THE KING</a></h2>


<p>"I wish I could see Robin Hood," said King Richard.
"I wish I could see him and his men shoot and wrestle
and go through all the feats in which they have such
wondrous skill. But if they heard that the king was
coming, they would think it was only to arrest them,
and they would flee deep into the forest and I should
never get a glimpse of them."</p>

<p>King Richard spoke kindly, for he was a king who
loved all manly sports and those who excelled in them.</p>

<p>"I would give a hundred pounds to see Robin Hood
and his men in the greenwood," he said.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you how you can see him without a doubt,"
spoke up one of the king's trusty companions with a
laugh. "Put on the robes of a fat abbot and ride<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
through Sherwood Forest with the hundred pounds in
your pouch, and you will be sure to see him and be
feasted by him."</p>

<p>"I'll do it," cried bluff King Richard, slapping his
knee. "It will be a huge joke."</p>

<p>So he and seven of his followers dressed themselves
as an abbot and seven black friars and rode out along
the highway toward Sherwood Forest. And Robin Hood
and his men took them and brought them to the Trystal
Tree, and there they searched them and took the
pouch of gold. But they gave half the gold back to
the king, for it was not their custom to leave any man
in need. They were pleased with these travelers because
they did not resist nor rail at them.</p>

<p>"Now we shall give you a feast that will be worth
fifty pounds," said Robin Hood.</p>

<p>"I have a good appetite for a feast," said the pretended
abbot, "but even more do I desire to see the
archery and wrestling and play with the quarter-staff
and all those things in which I am told you excel."</p>

<p>"You shall see the very best we can do," answered
Robin Hood. "But, I pray you, holy father, lay aside
your cowl that you may enjoy this sweet evening air."</p>

<p>"No," answered the mock abbot. "It may not be,
for I and my brothers have vowed not to let our faces
be seen during this journey."</p>

<p>"Very well, then," said Robin Hood. "I interfere
with no man's vows." And he never dreamed that it
was the king.</p>

<p>They gave them a splendid feast of roasted venison
and pheasant and fish and wild fowls, all done to a
turn over the roaring fire, and the best of drink. Then
they arranged the sports.</p>

<p>The target was a garland of leaves and flowers that
was hung six score paces distant upon a stake. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
a mark that only the best of archers could hit at all.</p>

<p>"Now shoot!" said Robin Hood. "You shall each
of you have three shots, and every one who fails to
place his arrows within the garland shall forfeit the
arrow and receive beside a box on the side of the head
as stout as can be given."</p>

<p>"Can any one hit inside that little garland at such
a distance?" asked the king in amaze.</p>

<p>"Look and see," answered Robin Hood proudly.</p>

<p>First, David of Doncaster shot, and lodged all three
arrows within the garland, while the king looked on,
astonished. Then Midge, the miller's son, and he also
placed all his arrows inside of the garland. Then Wat
the Tinker drew his bow; but he was unlucky, for one
of his arrows missed the mark by the breadth of two
fingers.</p>

<p>"Come here and take your punishment," called
Robin Hood. The king supposed that, since he had
missed by so little, he would receive but a light tap,
but he got a blow that knocked him spinning across
the grass, heels over head.</p>

<p>"Ha, ha, ha!" laughed his comrades, and "O ho!"
thought King Richard, "I am glad I am not in this."
But he was much impressed with the way Robin Hood's
men obeyed him.</p>

<p>"They are better to follow his commands than my
servants are to follow mine," he thought.</p>

<p>The shooting went on, and most of the men shot
their arrows within the garland, but a few missed and
received tremendous buffets.</p>

<p>Last Robin Hood shot. His first shaft split off a
piece of the stake on which the garland was hung. His
second lodged a scant inch from the first. But the last
arrow he shot was feathered faultily, and it swerved to
one side, and smote an inch outside of the garland.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>Then all the company roared with good-natured
laughter, for it was seldom indeed that they saw their
master miss.</p>

<p>"Go and take your punishment, master," said Midge,
the miller's son. "I hope it will be as heavy as
Wat's."</p>

<p>"Well," said Robin Hood, "I will forfeit my arrow
to our guest and take my buffet from him."</p>

<p>Now the merry Robin was somewhat crafty in this,
for, though he did not mind hard knocks at all, he did
not like the thought of being sent sprawling before his
band. The hands of churchmen were soft, and their
strongest blows but feeble, for they did not work nor
use their muscles much. But the pretended abbot bared
an arm so stout and muscular that it made the yeomen
stare. Robin Hood placed himself fairly in front of
him and he struck a blow that would have felled an
ox. Down went Robin Hood on the ground rolling over
and over, and his men fairly shouted with laughter.</p>

<p>"Well," said Robin Hood, sitting up, half dazed,
"I did not think that there was an arm in England
that could strike such a blow. Who are you, man?
I'll warrant you are no churchman as you seem."</p>

<p>Then Richard threw his cowl, and Robin knew his
king. If he had been a disloyal man as well as an outlaw,
he would have trembled then. But, though he
knelt at the king's feet and signalled all his men to
kneel, his voice was not ashamed.</p>

<p>"Your majesty," he said, "you have no subjects in
all England more loyal to you than I and my merry
men. We have done no evil except to certain of the
greedy and rich who oppressed your subjects. We
crave your pardon if we have done wrong, and we beg
for your protection, and swear that we will ever serve
you faithfully."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>Then the king looked down in amazement that an
outlaw should speak so. But he knew men, and he
knew what people said of Robin Hood. And he knew,
too, that he was the best archer in all England and he
wanted him in his own train.</p>

<p>"I will forgive all your law-breaking," he said, "if
you will come with me to my court and serve me
there. You shall take Little John and Will Scarlet
and Allen-a-Dale, who is the sweetest singer I ever
heard; and the rest of your men I will make into
royal rangers, since I judge that they can protect Sherwood
Forest better than any others."</p>

<p>So Robin Hood left the greenwood and went to the
king's court and he served King Richard well. But he
did not like the confinement of the court and could not
abide the gaieties and jealousies of the courtiers. After
King Richard died, his brother John took the throne,
and he was one of the worst kings that ever ruled
England. Then Robin Hood went back to the forest
and his merry men gathered around him once more,
and again they became outlaws. And there in the
forest he lived till he died.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="DEATH_OF_ROBIN_HOOD" id="DEATH_OF_ROBIN_HOOD">DEATH OF ROBIN HOOD</a></h2>


<p>Now the manner of Robin Hood's death was in this
wise. He had grown to be an old man, and he became
ill of a fever.</p>

<p>"I will go to my cousin, the prioress of Kirklees,
for she hath much knowledge of healing," he said.
"I will ask her to bleed me that I may become well."</p>

<p>In those days the women had more knowledge of
healing than any others, for it was the duty of every
mother and daughter to learn as much as she could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
about it that she might know what to do if her husband
or her son were wounded. This cousin of Robin Hood's
was greatly indebted to him, for he had got her her
good place as prioress. But she loved one of his
enemies, and she dealt treacherously with him.</p>

<p>She opened a vein in his arm, but she did not close
it up again. Then she left him alone in a high room
at the very top of the priory to bleed to death. All
day long he bled till he was so weak that he could
hardly move. But at evening he managed to lift his
bugle to his lips and blow. The blast was but feeble,
but Little John heard it, for, though the prioress refused
to let him in with Robin Hood, he had lingered
as close to his dear master as he could get, all day long.</p>

<p>The prioress locked the great entry door so that he
might not come in, and he seized a huge stone mortar
that three men could not lift ordinarily and hurled it
against the door, crashing it in. Then he dashed up
the winding stairs and none could stay him until he
reached the room under the eaves where his master
lay. But he saw at a glance that Robin Hood was
dying.</p>

<p>"Master," he cried, "I will burn the priory down
over the heads of these vile nuns whose mistress has
done you such dreadful treachery."</p>

<p>"No, no," said Robin Hood, with a smile that was
feeble but was wondrous sweet. "I have never hurt a
woman in my life nor allowed my followers to do it.
I could not allow such a thing now."</p>

<p>And with almost his last breath he made Little John
promise to do no injury to the treacherous nun who
had killed him.</p>

<p>There are many more stories about Robin Hood.
There is not space enough here to put down half of
them. I hope you will ask for them at the library and
read them all, and some of the quaint old ballads about
him too. And I hope, most of all, that every boy who
reads them will try to be as kindly and as helpful and
as generous and as brave and chivalrous to all woman-kind
as Robin Hood was.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
